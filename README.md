## Thesis Title
An Interdisciplinary Investigation of Character Networks, Event Types, and Plot Progression in the Film 'Notting Hill' 

## Thesis Abstract

There has been a lot of focus on exploring cinema narrative structures in the digital humanities and film studies. The aim of this study is to find out whether there are certain patterns and connections between character networks, event types, and plot developments that are important elements of narratives in movie narratives. Finding and studying connections between these narrative features and new readings of cinema narratives is the primary goal of this study.

This interdisciplinary study uses computational analytics and data visualization tools to dive into cinema narratives using a digital humanities approach. The research uses these methods to infer hidden patterns and understand the structural foundations of narrative development in a cinematic narrative. The primary objective of the research is to explore the use of digital methods to enhance our understanding of cinema narratives by offering a deeper understanding of narrative patterns and linkages. Namely, it does so by employing objective data-driven qualitative analytic tools to probe story elements including character networks, event types, and plot progression.

## Data Analysis
The purpose of this study is to investigate how characters, event types, and movie plot development relate to one another. The necessary data was gathered through manual annotation of secondary data sources in order to accomplish this goal.
This study employs a number of statistical and visualization methods to examine whether there are associations between characters and events in Notting Hill. After finishing the annotation of the film and collecting data such as movie events, event types, character interactions, and behavioral connections, the data were processed for this study. Here, I'm only uploading the part about processing the data and the part about visualizing the data.
